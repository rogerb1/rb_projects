                I am passionate about data, web development, and user interface design. I plan to major in computer science or a related
                field. The purpose of this site is to document personal projects.

                    I wanted to program something from scratch using JavaScript in order to get more practice with the language. This project
                    was in collaboration with my friend who focused on the design and CSS. The first idea I had in mind was
                    some sort of interactive game that taught multiplication. Having a background in Java, I looked back
                    into concepts that I learned from taking UWâ€™s CSE 142 class. That said, I developed this game using an
                    object oriented approach.

                    Animations have always caught my attention. I wanted to work with css only and create a gallery of animated shapes using
                    keyframes. This is an on going project dedicated to push the limits of the language.

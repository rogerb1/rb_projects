            <h1>Study of Suicide in Washington</h1>
            <h3>NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States</h3>
            <p class="about-set">
                The data studied comes from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
                <a class="data-link" href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu">[Data]</a>
            </p>
            <p class="about-set">
                For this study I choose Washington because that is the state I live in and was curious to see if there were any changes as
                time went by.
